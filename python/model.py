    y_raw : a Numpy array, with the value of the claims, in the same order as contracts in X_raw.

    This functions estimates the expected claim made by a contract (typically, as the product
    of the probability of having a claim multiplied by the expected cost of a claim if it occurs),
    for each contract in the dataset X_raw.

    This is the function used in the RMSE leaderboard, and hence the output should be as close
    as possible to the expected cost of a contract.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: a Python object that describes your model. This can be anything, as long
        as it is consistent with what `fit` outpurs.
    X_raw : Pandas dataframe, with the columns described in the data dictionary.

    Returns

        expected claim per contract (in same order). These expected claims must be POSITIVE (>0).

	This is the function used in the expected profit leaderboard. Prices output here will
	be used in competition with other models, so feel free to use a pricing strategy.

	model: a Python object that describes your model. This can be anything, as long

	X_raw : Pandas dataframe, with the columns described in the data dictionary.
		Each row is a different contract. This data has not been processed.
