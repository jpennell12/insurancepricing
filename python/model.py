    Parameters
    ----------

    y_raw : a Numpy array, with the value of the claims, in the same order as contracts in X_raw.

        with your prediction methods.

    This functions estimates the expected claim made by a contract (typically, as the product
    of the probability of having a claim multiplied by the expected cost of a claim if it occurs),
    for each contract in the dataset X_raw.

    This is the function used in the RMSE leaderboard, and hence the output should be as close
    as possible to the expected cost of a contract.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: a Python object that describes your model. This can be anything, as long
        as it is consistent with what `fit` outpurs.
    X_raw : Pandas dataframe, with the columns described in the data dictionary.
        Each row is a different contract. This data has not been processed.

    Returns
    -------
    avg_claims: a one-dimensional Numpy array of the same length as X_raw, with one
        expected claim per contract (in same order). These expected claims must be POSITIVE (>0).

	predict_expected_claim, and will add some pricing strategy on top.

	This is the function used in the expected profit leaderboard. Prices output here will
	be used in competition with other models, so feel free to use a pricing strategy.

	Parameters
	----------
	model: a Python object that describes your model. This can be anything, as long

	X_raw : Pandas dataframe, with the columns described in the data dictionary.
